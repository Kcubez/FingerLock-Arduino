# FingerLock: Smart Fingerprint-Based Door Lock System
FingerLock is an advanced, IoT-enabled fingerprint authentication system for secure door access control. This Arduino-based project combines biometric security with smart home features to provide a reliable and user-friendly locking mechanism.

## Features:

1. Fingerprint Authentication: Uses an Adafruit Fingerprint sensor for secure biometric access.

2. Smart Lock Control: Operates an electronic lock (likely a solenoid) via a relay.
Visual Feedback:

3. LED indicators: Green for successful authentication, Red for failed attempts.
LCD display for user instructions and status messages.


4. Audible Alerts: Buzzer sounds for unauthorized access attempts.
IoT Integration:

5. Connects to WiFi for remote monitoring and control.
Uses Blynk platform for mobile app integration.


6. Theft Detection: Logs failed access attempts and can send notifications.

7. Toggle Lock State: Users can lock and unlock the door with authenticated fingerprints.
Auto-Lock Reminder: Prompts users to lock the door when left open.

This system provides a secure, convenient, and smart solution for residential or commercial door access control, combining local biometric authentication with IoT capabilities for enhanced security and user experience.
